C Programming Mini Projects Repository

This repository contains three fundamental C programming tasks designed to strengthen core programming concepts and problem-solving skills.
The projects include:

Calculator Program – A basic arithmetic calculator that performs operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using structured logic.

Matrix Operations Program – Implements common matrix operations including addition, subtraction, and multiplication using 2D arrays.

Student Management System (Major Project) – A menu-driven application that manages student records using structures and file handling. It supports adding, updating, deleting, searching, and displaying student information with persistent data storage.

These projects demonstrate the use of functions, structures, arrays, loops, conditional statements, and file handling in C. The repository is suitable for beginners and intermediate learners looking to build strong programming foundations through practical implementations.
